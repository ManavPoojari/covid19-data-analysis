# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

This is a simple data analysis project where I explored COVID-19 global trends using Python. The main idea was to take raw data from the pandemic and turn it into visual insights—things like how cases evolved over time, how different countries were impacted, and what the mortality rates looked like.

I used basic data science tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn—no machine learning or heavy stuff, just clean code and useful charts.


## 🧾 What This Project Includes

- 📅 Trend of confirmed cases over time (Top 5 countries)
- 📊 Deaths vs Recoveries (Latest available date)
- 💀 Mortality rate comparison between the top affected countries
- 📁 Final summary saved as a CSV file for reference


## 📊 Visuals Included

### 1. Confirmed Cases Over Time
Shows how the pandemic evolved in the 5 most affected countries.

🛠️ Tools I Used
Python 3
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

If you're into data science or just want to practice visualization, this is a good starter.

🧪 How to Run It
Make sure you have Python installed. Then:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-analysis-manav.git
cd covid19-analysis-manav
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
python covid19_analysis_manav.py
It'll generate all the plots and save the final summary file.

📌 Dataset Info
I used a public COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle, which contains global daily updates of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
